Curves and Ruled Surfaces over Curves
=============================================

Curves in Pycao are always parametrized curves. They are used:

- for a film or an animation : the camera and the
  point you look at move on curves 

- in the construction of objects : Lathe objects, and ruled surfaces

There are three types of Curves :

- polylines

- bezier Curves

- piecewise curves which are obtained by gluing pieces of curves

Notations for the control points
-----------------------------------

Polylines and Bezier Curves are defined by control points. The list
used to define the control points may be simply the list of
points you use. We call it the list of absolute positions.
But you can also include vectors in the list, to
indicate that your input is the difference of coordinate with the
previous point. For instance, suppose you have your list of control
points 

.. code-block:: python

   l=[p0,p1,p2,p3,p4,p5]

with    

.. code-block:: python

   p4=origin
   p5=origin+X+2*Z

then, you could alternativly use for the list of control points

.. code-block:: python

   l=[p0,p1,p2,p3,p4,v5]

with    

.. code-block:: python

   p4=origin
   v5=X+2*Z

You don't need any special
declaration. When pycao encounters a vector rather than a point, it
knows that you are talking about the relative position from the
previous point. For instance, the following three lists correspond
to the points on a plane square. The first list indicates absolute
positions, the second list relative positions, the third one is a mix.
		 
.. code-block:: python

   l1=[origin, point(1,0,0),point(1,1,0),point(0,1,0)]
   l2=[origin, X,Y,-X]
   l3=[origin,X,point(1,1,0),-X]

  
Polyline and Bezier Curves
---------------------------------------------------

.. image:: ./generatedImages/curves1.png

The following sequence builds the basic usable curves, 
namely a Bezier curve and a Polyline. Since a curve is infinitly
thin, it is not possible to see it even if camera.filmActors=True.
We use the method show()
to add spheres along the curve to visualize it. The options
of show() allow to choose a different color for the control points and
for the sphere along the curve.

Interpolation and Piecewise curves
--------------------------------------------



Usually we want a smooth interpolation curve. Thus neither
the Bezier curve ( it passes close to the control points, but not
exactly  through the control points)
neither the polyline (not smooth ) are suitable. 

To solve this problem, pycao offers an interpolation curve which
does the job. It is built from several Bezier Curves joined together. 
If the option closeCurve=True, Pycao will add a last point in your
list coinciding with the initial point and will make a smooth
junction. As a result, the curve is closed and
appears smooth at the junction point between the start and the
end of the curve.

All the curves above have been made with the same list of control
points, shown in green. What makes the difference is the speed of the
curve at the control points. When the curves goes slowly through the
control point, the change of direction is fast. On the other hand, if
the speed is hign, the curve keeps its direction a bit longer.
On the picture, the small speed is for the pink curve. The speed is
so small that the curve looks like a polyline. The default speed is
for the blue curve. The highest speed is
on the top, for the red curve, where the speed is so high that the
curve goes too far and needs to come back to go to the next point. 

The direction of the vector speed at the point p_i is parallel to
the vector p_{i+1}-p_{i-1}. It is only the norm of the speed vector
that you control with the speed parameters. For each control point,
you can choose two constants, a constant to control the speed used when the curve approaches the control
point, and another constant for the speed used  when the curve leaves the control point.


On the right part of the picture, the green curve is a curve where the
approching speed is different from the leaving speed. For the other
curves, the approach speed is equal to the leaving speed. 


Choosing the speed for each control point may be tedious, thus
you can control all the points simultaneously using the parameter

.. code-block:: python

   speedConstants=[approachingSpeed,leavingSpeed]

If you prefer, you can control the points individually using the parameters 

.. code-block:: python

   approachSpeed=[speedAtPoint0,speedAtPoint1,...]
   leavingSpeed=[speedAtPoint0,speedAtPoint1,...]



		 
Ruled  Surfaces built on curves
---------------------------------------------

Ruled surfaces are a generalization of Prisms and extruded surfaces. 

It is possible to fill a closed curve to get a surface. For
instance, if we fill a circle, we get a disk.  The calling sequence
is RuledSurface.fromCurveFilling(curve), as illustrated in the red example below. 

It is possible to construct a ruled surface by joining the points
C(t) and D(t) of two curves C and D. The following example
illustrates that the result depends on the
parametrization of C and D . The violet join uses curves
similar to the green join, but with a different parametrization equivalent to
a rotation of the bottom curve.  It looks like we have applied a
torsion to an aluminium can. The violet join also illustrates that we can optionally
add caps at the extremities of the join.

Lathe 
--------------------

The lathe object is defined by rotating a curve located in the half plane z=0,
x>0 around the Y-axis.
