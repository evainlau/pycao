ipython
----------------
We have presented many functions in this introduction. 
Recall that ipython is a wonderful tool to find the information
quickly, with more details than in this introduction. 

Suppose for instance, we want to create a cylinder but
we don't remember the syntax.  We can get information
on the Cylinder class immediatly by typing ?Cylinder in ipython.
And we can get the complete code for  the Cylinder class
by typing ??Cylinder. 


A file called "ipycao" has been prepared for easy
interaction with ipython. It is in the located in 
the core directory of pycao. 
As for templates, the variable
pycaoDir needs to be settled before using the file. 
Once the pycaoDir variable is settled in the ipycao file, 
we cd to core directory of ipycao.py and we  type "ipython" or "ipython3"
to launch ipython. When we have the python prompt, we enter:
"run ipycao.py"

THen we can interact with pycao and ask information or source code on a function,class, variable ... 
For instance, ?camera and ??camera to get the information on the
camera class as explained above. Moreover,
to get the methods of construction of an object,
recall that many constructions start with the string from.
Thus to see the many ways to define a plane,
in ipython, enter "plane.from" and press  tab for completion.
You will see the name of the functions to construct a plane.
