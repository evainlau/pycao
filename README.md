 PYCAO
===============================

This is the pycao modeller.
In short, this is a tool to
describe a 3D-scene using
the python language, with plenty
of simplifying paradigms
( carrying objects in boxes,
genealogy system, compact mathematical notations,
markers ... ).
Then you can see your 3d objects
using povray as a plugin. 


The documentation  is available
on my home page
at the university of Angers.
