Construction of simple objects 
=================================

Examples
--------
The following objects are native in Pycao, ie. they
can be defined with one or two lines of code. 
We shall see in the next chapters how to intersect, move,
link them... to get the desired  3D-scene starting from these
objects.

Te code below indicates how to use these objects. For objects built on
curves, the full syntax will be explained in the chapter on curves but
we include them here so that you are informed of the possibilities.
